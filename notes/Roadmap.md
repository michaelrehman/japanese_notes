# Roadmap

## The Goal
**JLPT N4 on December 6, 2020**

## Layout
1. 1. [ ] [Genki I](#genki-i)
2. 2. [ ] [Genki II](#genki-ii)
3. 3. [ ] [Supplemental](#supplemental)
4. 4. [ ] [Advanced](#advanced)
* * [ ] [Vocabulary](#vocabulary-and-kanji)
* * [ ] [Kanji](#vocabulary-and-kanji)
* * [ ] [Intonation and Pitch Accent](#intonation-and-pitch-accent)

#### Explanation
* The former four are ordered as they are to be done in the order they are listed in
* The latter three are unordered as they are to be done in conjunction with the four main ordered phases
* Genki I and Genki II should be used to build a solid grammar foundation that will make it easier to learn new vocabulary and kanji
* Studying intonation and pitch accent is important in developing proper pronounciation but is secondary to being able to actually speak and understand Japanese
  * Feel free to completely ignore studying intonation and pitch accent

## Genki I
* Genki I Textbook
* Genki I Workbook
* Supplement Genki I 文法 with [online resources](./Japanese Resources.md)
  * I.e., elaborate on the presented grammar

## Genki II
* Genki II Textbook
* Genki II Workbook
* Supplement Genki II 文法 with [online resources](./Japanese Resources.md)
  * I.e., elaborate on the presented grammar

## Supplemental
* [Japanese From Zero! YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOcym2c7xnBwU12Flkm5RcLIEhvURQ8TB)
* [Japanese Particles](https://japanesequizzes.com/all-about-japanese-particles/)
* This is mainly to fill in the gaps not covered by the Genki series to make the transition to intermediate and advanced Japanese smoother

#### Specific Topics
* Time
  * Ask and tell what time it is
  * Ask for and tell when an event it
  * Specify ranges of time
  * "For X [measurement of time]"
  * Action order (後、前、～てから)
* Particles
  * 「もう」と「まだ」
  * 「だけ」と「しか」
  * 「から」と「まで」
  * 「に」 for indirect objects
  * etc.
* Location and Movement
  * Ask for and give directions
  * Describe where something is
* こそあど Words
  * どれ Group
  * どの Group
  * どこ Group
  * どんな Group
  * どっち Group
  * どちら Group
* Converting Adjectives to Adverbs
* Interrogatives
  * 「なぜ」と「どうして」と「何で」の違い
    * Spoiler alert: the only difference is that なぜ is more formal
  * 「どう」と「どうして」と「どうやって」の違い
  * 「なんか」
* 「同じです」と「違います」

## Advanced
* Utilize [online resources](./Japanese Resources.md) to learn grammer not taught in Genki
* Now that a solid grammar foundation has been built, start shifting focus from learning new grammar to intonation and pitch accent, vocabulary, and kanji
* Consider using the *Tobira Gateway to Advanced Japanese* and *An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese* textbooks and associated workbooks for guidance and practice

## Vocabulary and Kanji
* Anki for language learning
* *Remembering the Kanji* series written by James W. Heisig
* Japanese Kanji Tree app

## Intonation and Pitch Accent
* Unfortunately, this is not an easy topic to study as most resources are written in Japanese, so advanced Japanese grammer is almost required
  * Although there are pitch accent dictionaries, there isn't much concering conjugations and particles
* *The Phonology of Japanese (The Phonology of the World's Languages)* written by Laruence Labrune seems to be a good starting point
  * However, this book seems to focus more on the history of the Japanese language instead of pitch accent
* Dogen's 10$/month patreon series seems to be the best bet if it can be afforded
  * This series covers conjugations, particles, and pitch accent patterns
