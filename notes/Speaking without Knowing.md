# [Speaking without Knowing](https://youtu.be/_IOZbJ7PCPk?t=467)
* Often times, people forget the word for something but are still able to describe/ask what it is by qualifying concept words.

## Concept Words
| Term | Meaning |
| :--: | :-----: |
| 物 (もの) | concrete thing |
| 事 (こと) | abstract thing |
| 状態 (じょうたい) | situation/circumstancs |
| 所 (ところ) | concrete or abstract place |
* If you do not know a certain word, describe what you're thinking by qualifying nouns with adjectives and verbs.
  * Remember that the patter to qualify a noun with a な-adjective is `な-adjective + noun`
  * The pattern for qualifying nouns with verbs is `short form + noun`
    * Since こと is a generic noun, qualifying it with a verb is simply [nominalizing the verb](#nominalizing-verbs)
  * When qualifying a noun with another noun, the two are connected with the particle の (e.g., 日本大学の学生)

#### Nominalizing Verbs

* Nominalizing verbs in the short form with こと expresses the idea of doing that verb
  * E.g., 歌う means "to sing," but 歌うこと means "(the action of) singing."
  * の is also used to nominalize verbs, but has different nuances than こと
  * Note that the kanji for こと (事) is not used for nominalizing as there are words that incorporate 事 into them
  * This is the same grammar point used in 「～たことがある」 and is similar to other grammar points that use nouns (e.g., 「～つもり」)

## Examples
* Forgot "library" (図書館)? Say 「本を貸し出すところ」 for "place that lends books."
* Don't know "scissors" (ハサミ)? Say 「切るもの」 for "cutting thing."
* Want to say "the time when I was in high school"? Say 「高校生の時のこと」.
