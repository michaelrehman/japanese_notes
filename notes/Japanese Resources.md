# Japanese Resources
* This is an index of external resources listed in *no particular order* for learning Japanese.
* If choosing to learn pitch accent, I personally recommend focusing on building a strong grammar foundation first.

## Specific Topics

#### Particles
* [Summary Article on Common Particles](https://kawakawalearningstudio.com/all/japanese-particles/)
* [から, まで, しか, だけ](https://kawakawalearningstudio.com/all/how-to-use-japanese-particles-%e3%81%8b%e3%82%89kara-%e3%81%be%e3%81%a7made-%e3%81%a0%e3%81%91dake-and-%e3%81%97%e3%81%8bshika-that-will-make-good-sentences/)
  * Note that this article has links to other articles for other particles.
* [Lists of Nouns](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/multiple_nouns)
  * Not entirely sure how 「～たり」 differs from using the particles in the article with nominalized verbs.
* [All About Japanese Particles](https://japanesequizzes.com/all-about-japanese-particles/) - A series on Japanese particles.
  * A ***very*** good resource for particles, but, like most others, it's more of an explanation of what they express rather than how to use them.

###### 「もう」と「まだ」
* [Thorough Article on もう and まだ](http://maggiesensei.com/2016/07/09/how-to-use-%E3%82%82%E3%81%86-%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A0-mou-mada/)
* [***Brief*** Explanation of もう and まだ](https://japanesemeow.com/japanese-grammar-lessons/the-status-of-an-event-with-mou-and-mada/)
  * もう indicates a change in state
  * まだ indicates an unchanged state
* [Video on もう](https://youtu.be/5KREBS3pMNI)
* [Video on まだ](https://youtu.be/zn5c_0iUgGU)
* [まだ + ～ていない/いません Video](https://youtu.be/1hm72ZiWc6g)

#### 時
* [Article on Most Japanese Time Expressions](http://maggiesensei.com/2009/09/24/time-related-japanese-re-uploaded-%e6%99%82%e3%81%ae%e6%97%a5%e6%9c%ac%e8%aa%9e%ef%bc%88toki-no-nihongo/)
  1. [Follow-up Article 1](http://maggiesensei.com/2015/04/10/%E6%99%82%E9%96%93-jikan-time-related-japanese/)
  2. [Follow-up Article 2](http://maggiesensei.com/2016/01/28/time-expressions-with-and-without-a-particle/)
* [～時 - Expressing "When A, B."](https://www.learn-japanese-adventure.com/toki-in-japanese.html)
  * [Additional Article](https://japanesemeow.com/japanese-grammar-lessons/toki/)
  * Note that Genki 16.4 covers this expression with respect to verbs, including the strange temporal relation between the clauses.
    * In short, A should be in the present/future tense if it occurs after B and in the past tense if it occured before B.
* [Specifying Durations of Time](https://www.learn-japanese-adventure.com/japanese-numbers-durations.html)
  * [When to Use 間](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/55di7n/when_saying_frequency_per_period_why_is_%E9%96%93_only/)
* The particles から and まで can be used to express "from ..." and "until ..." respectively.
  * Using them together with time expressions can specify a range of time.

###### Action Order
* [Thorough Article on 後](http://maggiesensei.com/2018/01/22/how-to-use-%E5%BE%8C-%E3%81%82%E3%81%A8-ato/)
  * The verb that precedes 後 (あと) should be in plain past affirmative form.
    * ～する verbs can alternatively choose to replace 「する」 with 「後 (ご)」.
  * [Additional Summary Article](http://selftaughtjapanese.com/2015/06/05/all-about-japanese-%E5%BE%8C-ato-go-kou-after/)
  * [「～てから」と「～たあとで」](https://youtu.be/3nAtE6LKwmk)
    * [yahoo Thread on the Nuance of 後 and ～てから](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101010082532AA3BAZ3)
* [Japanese Action Order](https://youtu.be/WE9nA79OHsM)
  * ～て form implies an implicit action order as well.

#### Saying "if"
* [Conditionals](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar/conditionals)
  * This is a good overview, but personally I find it lacking.
* [Video on ～たら](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrnjEazL4dg)
* [Article on ～なら](https://japanesetest4you.com/flashcard/learn-jlpt-n4-grammar-%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89-nara/)

#### Pitch Accent and Intonation
* ***Note that studying pitch accent is not necessary, and these resources are here only for those interested in pursuing a native accent.***
  * The necessity of studying pitch accent is debated in the language learning community as it is not necessary for natives to understand you.
* [Pitch Accent Overview](https://youtu.be/O6AoilGEers)
* [First Video of Dogen's Series](https://youtu.be/jakXVEUTT48)
  * The resources Dogen used to learn pitch accent are listed in the video's description.
  * Dogen is largely responsible for popularizing the study of pitch accent and has a patreon series teaching it in depth.
* [Showcase of Various Resources](https://youtu.be/zRSXbqjC2Yg)
  * This is also the seventh video in Dogen's pitch accent series that was made free.
* [Reddit Thread on Pitch Accent Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/2lhq9e/true_phonetic_dictionary_with_pitch_accent/)
* [YouTube Playlist of Various Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_II4xBX97_Ab10jt9N0HZC9Soy79E2Lz)
* The Android app of [Takoboto](http://takoboto.jp/) also has pitch accent data.

#### 漢字
* [Kanji Map](https://thekanjimap.com)
  * As someone who dabbles in web development, this is a really cool web app.
  * Be sure to look at the Kanji and About pages for more information.
* [Kanji by Concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kanji_by_concept)
* [常用漢字](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)

| [baileysnyder.com/jconj/](http://baileysnyder.com/jconj/) | Basic Japanese conjugation practice. |
* JGram doesn't seem like it has been updated recently, but data is data.
* renshuu.org has rules on specific grammar, so I highly recommend it.

#### Textbooks
| Textbook | Description |
| :------: | ----------- |
| *Genki* | A beginner series of two books with respective workbooks. |
| *Japanese From Zero!* | A multi-book series on beginner Japanese with accompanying videos on YouTube. |

| *Tobira Gateway to Advanced Japanese* | A textbook written in Japanese that focuses on advanced Japanese. |
| *Remembering the Kanji* | A series of three books for remembering large amounts of kanji. |
* Note that the *Remembering the Kanji* series doesn't focus on vocabulary and pronounciation but rather on meaning.
* If you are already using the *Genki* series, I recommend continuing with it and supplementing it using the *Japanese From Zero!* YouTube videos as they are both beginner series.

#### Apps
| App | Description |
| :-: | ----------- |
| [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) | A sopshitaced piece of software for learning important bite-sized concepts. |
| [italki](https://www.italki.com/) | Learn from native speakers. |
| [HelloTalk](https://www.hellotalk.com/) | Chat with native speakers. |

  2. [Anki Tutorial 2 of 2](https://youtu.be/OMCCeeHnaFA)
  * As noted on the website, Anki is available for Android and iOS as AnkiDroid and AnkiMobile respectively
* Be careful with learning from native speakers that do not understand how to explain their own language. E.g., try explaining adjective order to a non-English speaker.
* HelloTalk is similar to italki, but it isn't a teaching platform.
* Personally, I recommend LingoDeer just for the extra practice it provides since the grammar points are not explored in depth.
