# 間 for Durations of Time
* This file is a summary of [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/55di7n/when_saying_frequency_per_period_why_is_%E9%96%93_only/) and [this article]()

## 分
* Because 分 is typically used with 時 to express an exact time (e.g., 十時三十五分 for 10:35), 分 by itself already implies a duration of minutes
  * Have you ever used *just* minutes to specify an exact time (e.g., "The time is 30 minutes.")

## 時
* Because 時 specifies a specific time (e.g., 六時 for 6:00), 時間 should be used to specify a duration of hours

## 日
* When specifying a duration of days, 間 should not be used with 一日 and is otherwise optional
  * Not entirely sure if 一日 being an exception is a hard and fast rule

## 週
* Couldn't find a reason why, but it seems that 間 is always used with 週 to specify a duration of weeks

## 月
* Months use a different character (ヶ) to specify duration (i.e., do not use 間 with durations of months)
  * ヶ example: 二ヶ月 (にかげつ), which means "for two months"

## 年
* Using 間 with 年 is optional to specify a duration of years
