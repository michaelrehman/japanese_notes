# 間 for Durations of Time
* This file is a summary of [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/55di7n/when_saying_frequency_per_period_why_is_%E9%96%93_only/) and [this article]()

## 秒
* For similar reasons discussed in [分](#分), 秒 should not take 間

## 分
* Because 分 is typically used with 時 to express an exact time (e.g., 十時三十五分 for 10:35), 分 by itself already implies a duration of minutes
  * Have you ever used *just* minutes to specify an exact time (e.g., "The time is 30 minutes.")

## 時

* Because 時 specifies a specific time (e.g., 六時 for 6:00), 時間 should be used to specify a duration of hours

## 日

* When specifying a duration of days, 間 should not be used with 一日 and is otherwise optional
  * E.g., 三日 (みっか) means "third day of the month" *and* "three days," whereas 三日間 (みっかかん) means "three days"

## 週
![Chart for weeks](https://www.learn-japanese-adventure.com/images/t3-japanese-durations-week.png)
* Couldn't find a reason why, but it seems that 間 is always used with 週 to specify a duration of weeks

## 月
![Chart for months](https://www.learn-japanese-adventure.com/images/t3-japanese-durations-month.png)
* Months use a different character (ヶ) to specify duration (i.e., do not use 間 with durations of months)
  * E.g., 二ヶ月 (にかげつ), which means "for two months," but 二月 (にがつ) means "February"

## 年
![Chart for years](https://www.learn-japanese-adventure.com/images/t3-japanese-durations-year.png)
* Using 間 with 年 is optional to specify a duration of years
